# CUDA + Rust examples

The examples in here showcase both the GPU side and the CPU side of writing a tool which uses the GPU.

## Available Examples

### [vecadd](vecadd)
A simple vector addition example demonstrating basic CUDA kernel usage.

### [gemm](gemm)
General Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) implementation showing more complex CUDA operations.

### [sha2_crates_io](sha2_crates_io)
Demonstrates using an existing Rust crate ([`sha2`](https://crates.io/crates/sha2) from crates.io) on both CPU and GPU without modification. Shows that the same cryptographic hashing code can run on CUDA, producing identical results to the CPU implementation.

### [Interactive Path Tracer](path_tracer)
A very simple interactive Path Tracer inspired by [Ray Tracing In One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html)
which runs on CPU or GPU, with the additional option of running OptiX denoising.

The Path Tracer uses cuda_builder to compile the core path tracer for the GPU and GPU (hardware raytracing), and uses the core path tracer as a normal crate
for CPU rendering and sharing structures.
