//! Safe, Fast, and user-friendly wrapper around the CUDA Driver API.
//!
//! # Low level CUDA interop
//!
//! Because additions to CUDA and libraries that use CUDA are everchanging, this library
//! provides unsafe functions for retrieving and setting handles to raw CUDA objects.
//! This allows advanced users to embed libraries that rely on CUDA, such as OptiX.
//!
//! # CUDA Terminology:
//!
//! ## Devices and Hosts:
//!
//! This crate and its documentation uses the terms "device" and "host" frequently, so it's worth
//! explaining them in more detail. A device refers to a CUDA-capable GPU or similar device and its
//! associated external memory space. The host is the CPU and its associated memory space. Data
//! must be transferred from host memory to device memory before the device can use it for
//! computations, and the results must then be transferred back to host memory.
//!
//! ## Contexts, Modules, Streams and Functions:
//!
//! A CUDA context is akin to a process on the host - it contains all of the state for working with
//! a device, all memory allocations, etc. Each context is associated with a single device.
//!
//! A Module is similar to a shared-object library - it is a piece of compiled code which exports
//! functions and global values. Functions can be loaded from modules and launched on a device as
//! one might load a function from a shared-object file and call it. Functions are also known as
//! kernels and the two terms will be used interchangeably.
//!
//! A Stream is akin to a thread - asynchronous work such as kernel execution can be queued into a
//! stream. Work within a single stream will execute sequentially in the order that it was
//! submitted, and may interleave with work from other streams.
//!
//! ## Grids, Blocks and Threads:
//!
//! CUDA devices typically execute kernel functions on many threads in parallel. These threads can
//! be grouped into thread blocks, which share an area of fast hardware memory known as shared
//! memory. Thread blocks can be one-, two-, or three-dimensional, which is helpful when working
//! with multi-dimensional data such as images. Thread blocks are then grouped into grids, which
//! can also be one-, two-, or three-dimensional.
//!
//! CUDA devices often contain multiple separate processors. Each processor is capable of excuting
//! many threads simultaneously, but they must be from the same thread block. Thus, it is important
//! to ensure that the grid size is large enough to provide work for all processors. On the other
//! hand, if the thread blocks are too small each processor will be under-utilized and the
//! code will be unable to make effective use of shared memory.
//!
//! # Usage:
//!
//! Before using cust, you must install the CUDA development libraries for your system. Version
//! 9.0 or newer is required. You must also have a CUDA-capable GPU installed with the appropriate
//! drivers.
//!
//! Cust will try to find the CUDA libraries automatically, if it is unable to find it, you can set
//! `CUDA_LIBRARY_PATH` to some path manually.
